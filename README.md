# End to End testing with Selenium on NodeJS
This is the source code for my [End to End testing with Selenium on NodeJS](https://medium.com/trisfera/end-to-end-testing-with-selenium-on-nodejs-d06d4b4e8cac) post, where I show how to setup end to end tests for an Express application.

## Getting Started
- Install NodeJS (v6.7.0 preferred)
- Install project dependencies `npm install`
- Run tests `npm test`

To run tests headlessly, make sure [xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) is installed and run:
```
npm run test:headless
```
