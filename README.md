# The simplest Flux implementation
This is the source code for my [The simplest Flux implementation](https://medium.com/trisfera/the-simplest-flux-implementation-a8518ecae1e0) post, where I show how to get Flux's benefits with plain React.

## Getting Started
- Install NodeJS (v6.7.0 preferred)
- Install project dependencies `npm install`
- Start app with `npm start`
- Run tests `npm test`
